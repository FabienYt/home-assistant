# FabienYt's Home Assistant Configuration

## About

This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, running my home automations.

This configuration is inspired by the structure proposed by [Franck Nijhof](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config).

## Contributing

I consider my personal Home Assistant configuration an active open-source project.
So if you feel like adding an improvement, feel free to contribute.

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:
